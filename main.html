	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        When analyzing algorithms and data structures, one crucial aspect to consider is their <strong>time complexity</strong>.
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input.
        An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity remains reasonably low even as the input size increases.
        It helps us compare different algorithms and choose the one that performs best for our specific requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another essential factor in algorithm analysis is <strong>space complexity</strong>.
        Space complexity measures the amount of memory space an algorithm or program needs to run as a function of the input size.
        One common notation used to describe space complexity is <strong>O(n)</strong>, where 'n' represents the input size.
        This notation signifies that the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size.
        Managing space complexity is crucial, especially in memory-constrained environments, to ensure optimal program execution.
