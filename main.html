	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Time complexity</strong> refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input.
        An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity remains reasonably low even as the input size increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, <strong>Space Complexity</strong> measures the amount of memory space an algorithm or program needs to run as a function of the input size.
        It's often denoted using Big O notation, such as <strong>O(n)</strong>, signifying that the space required grows linearly with the input size.
        Managing <strong>Space Complexity</strong> is crucial, especially in memory-constrained environments, to ensure optimal program execution.
